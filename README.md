***code-distortion/staticall*** is a package for that lets you call methods statically and non-statically.



## Installation

Install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require code-distortion/staticall
```



## Usage

- Include the `Staticall` trait in your class
- Add methods to your class, with the prefix `call`

``` php
<?php

use CodeDistortion\Staticall\Staticall;

class MyClass
{
    use Staticall;

    private function callMyMethod(): string
    {
        return 'hello';
    }
}
```

``` php
MyClass::myMethod(); // "hello"

$myObject = new MyClass();
$myObject->myMethod(); // "hello"
```

When a method is called statically like this, Staticall will instantiate the class first, and call the method against that.

This is useful for classes that have optional methods for chaining. Any of the methods can be called first.

``` php
MyClass::recipient('Bob', 'bob@test.com')->send();
MyClass::attach('file.zip')->recipient('Bob', 'bob@test.com')->send();
```

***Note:*** The constructor of your class must not accept any parameters.

***Note:*** Staticall makes the methods it finds, publicly accessible.

Your can change the method prefix by adding static property $staticallPrefix to your class.

``` php
<?php

use CodeDistortion\Staticall\Staticall;

class MyClass
{
    use Staticall;
    
    protected static $staticallPrefix = 'xyz';

    private function xyzMyMethod(): string
    {
        return 'hello';
    }
}
```



## Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
