***code-distortion/staticall*** is a package for that lets you call methods statically and non-statically.



## Installation

Install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require code-distortion/staticall
```



## Usage

- Include the `Staticall` trait in your class
- Add methods to your class, with the prefix `staticall`

``` php
<?php

use CodeDistortion\Staticall\Staticall; // <<<

class MyClass
{
    use Staticall; // <<<

    private function staticallMyMethod(): string // <<<
    {
        return 'hello';
    }
}
```

``` php
MyClass::myMethod(); // "hello"

// is equivalent to

$myObject = new MyClass();
$myObject->myMethod(); // "hello"
```

When a method is called statically like this, Staticall will instantiate the class first, and call the method against that.

This is useful for classes that have optional methods for chaining and any of the methods can be called first.

``` php
MyEmail::recipient('Bob', 'bob@test.com')->send();
MyEmail::attach('file.zip')->recipient('Bob', 'bob@test.com')->send();
```

> ***Note:*** Because Staticall calls your constructor automatically, the constructor must not have any required parameters.

>***Note:*** Staticall makes the methods it finds accessible publicly.

You can change the prefix Staticall uses by adding static property `$staticallPrefix` to your class:

``` php
<?php

use CodeDistortion\Staticall\Staticall;

class MyClass
{
    use Staticall;

    protected static string $staticallPrefix = 'xyz'; // <<<

    private function xyzMyMethod(): string // <<<
    {
        return 'hello';
    }
}
```
